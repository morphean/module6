    "A Basket Default Swap (BDS) is an OTC exotic and can be considered along with a Credit Default Swap as a product that offers some protection (it is unlikely that return would equal the original investment in the occurence of a default) against a credit event, but the difference is that a BDS insures against a credit event on the $k^{th}$ default on a basket of n reference names. It should be noted that the payment is made for that entity only and not the rest of the names in the basket. In this particular example we will be using 5:\n",
